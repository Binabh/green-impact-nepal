              Talk program on Forest Fire

              onclick="openModal([`Green Impact Nepal (GIN), in collaboration with the Himalayan Conservation Group (HICOG), organized a virtual talk program titled “Current Issues of Forest Fire in Nepal” on May 9, 2024. The aim of the program was to facilitate the exchange of information and share efforts made by professionals in the forest, including- Division Forest Offices and the Nepal Foresters’ Association (NFA). During the session, the key speakers highlighted the challenges faced by forest fires along with the mitigation and adaptive measures undertaken by the forest professionals. 6 speakers from different forest organizations and GIN representatives were invited as key speakers for the event, which was hosted by Garima Sharma. Over 100 enthusiastic participants from different universities, governments, and non-government organizations attended the 1.5-hour program through the online platform Zoom and other interested participants through Facebook Live. `,`The presentation on forest fire management in Nepal highlighted the importance of understanding the complex interplay of factors influencing forest fires, including topography, fuel, and climate. The speakers emphasized the need for effective fire management and conservation efforts in forest ecosystems. They shared their experiences and strategies for combating forest fires, including the use of drones and community engagement. The Divisional Forest Office, Marin, Sindhuli, has successfully integrated technology into their fire management, while the District Forest Officer, Dhading, stressed the need for strict laws and multi-level government involvement. The General Secretary of NFA  emphasized the role of combined efforts from forest professionals, community users, and local government in mitigating forest fires.`,`The speakers shared that the rate of forest fires is increasing. The problem of forest fires and a lack of preparedness and collaboration with different levels of government are the major challenges to forest fire control. Man-made fires are usually promoted for harming wildlife that has caused damage to agricultural and settlement lands. Another reason for the massive increase in forest fires is the deposition of forest residues and debris on the forest floor, as people are less dependent on them. The experts have put forth several recommendations aimed at reducing forest fires in the upcoming years. Firstly, it is crucial for all three levels of government—local, provincial, and federal—to collectively address forest fires as a priority issue, recognizing that the responsibility cannot solely rest on Forest Divisions. Additionally, implementing strict punishments for offenders and ensuring the dissemination of such punitive measures through media channels can serve as a deterrent. Moreover, timely debris collection, fostering transboundary cooperation between local governments and forest division offices, and employing drones for effective forest patrolling, and implementing active forest management strategies are identified as key measures to mitigate the occurrence of forest fires significantly.`])"

This initiative specifically targeted students and professionals, inviting them to create and share informative reels that highlight the importance of biodiversity. We received a plethora of creative and educational reels through our Instagram and Facebook pages, reflecting a broad range of perspectives and insights. To encourage continued engagement and recognize outstanding contributions, we awarded prizes to two participants, evaluating their reels based on a balanced criterion of 50% popularity and 50% content quality. This dual assessment ensured that the winners were not only popular but also provided valuable information.`,`Through such awareness campaigns, especially on significant days like IDB, we aim to increase public awareness about the importance of biodiversity, foster a sense of responsibility in exploiting natural resources, and promote steps toward the conservation and sustainable management of our natural environment. These efforts are vital in educating the public and inspiring proactive measures to protect our planet's biodiversity for future generations.`])"

As the group hiked, Mr. Manandhar continuously briefed participants, pointing out the warehouse for the industry and the production site, and highlighting the significant environmental degradation caused by the marble factory.`,`Following this educational session, the group proceeded to the botanical garden in Godawari, where participants had the opportunity to enjoy lunch amidst nature. This setting fostered an engaging experience-sharing session, during which all participants shared their experiences about the hike and their views on Marble Dada. Some suggested that, from a tourism perspective, Marble Dada could flourish and be developed into a place for practical learning. These discussions emphasized the potential for eco-tourism and educational initiatives to complement restoration efforts. The event concluded with closing remarks from Mr. Sunil Manandhar, who reiterated the critical need for ongoing restoration efforts at Marble Dada.
